Project Title: Web-Based Pure-Tone Audiometry Test

Project Description:
Create a Python-hosted web application that conducts a pure-tone hearing test. The application should allow users to test their hearing across multiple frequencies by playing calibrated pure-tone audio signals and recording their responses. The results should be presented visually and stored for later reference.

Key Features:
User Interface:

Clean and responsive UI using HTML, CSS (Tailwind preferred), and JavaScript.
Frequency selection slider (125 Hz – 16 kHz, standard audiometry range).
Volume control for each frequency to determine threshold levels.
A simple start/test interface for ease of use.
Audio Processing:

Generate pure-tone sine wave sounds dynamically using JavaScript's Web Audio API.
Ensure consistent sound playback without clicks or distortions.
Control output amplitude to measure user response at different volume levels.
User Interaction & Data Collection:

Users should respond to hearing a tone by clicking a button.
Store frequency and response data to plot a hearing threshold curve.
Option to download results as a CSV file.
Backend (Python & Flask/FastAPI):

Host the web application and manage user data.
Provide an API to store and retrieve test results.
Serve the frontend files and handle user interactions.
Visualization & Reporting:

Display an audiogram-like chart plotting the user’s hearing threshold per frequency.
Allow users to compare results over time.
Provide an option to export results as a PDF report.
Deployment:

The application should be easily deployable via Flask or FastAPI.
Docker support for easy hosting and containerization.
Option for local execution and cloud hosting via platforms like Render or Vercel.
README: Web-Based Pure-Tone Hearing Tests
Overview:
A pure-tone audiometry test is a hearing evaluation technique that measures an individual's ability to hear different frequencies at various intensities. This web-based version replicates a basic audiometric test using a browser’s Web Audio API and a Python backend for data handling.

How It Works:
Test Initialization:

The user selects their preferred audio output device (headphones recommended).
The application generates a series of pure tones at predefined frequencies.
The test starts at a low volume, gradually increasing until the user responds.
Hearing Threshold Detection:

The user acknowledges hearing a sound by clicking a button.
The system records the minimum volume level at which the tone was detected.
This process repeats for all test frequencies.
Data Collection & Analysis:

Each response is logged, forming a hearing threshold curve.
The final results are plotted as an audiogram-style chart.
Users can download or share their results.
Technical Details:
Frontend:

Uses JavaScript’s Web Audio API to generate sine wave tones dynamically.
Implements a user-friendly interface with a frequency slider and response buttons.
Backend (Python - Flask/FastAPI):

Handles result storage and retrieval.
Provides an API for downloading test data.
Hosts the web interface.
Data Storage:

Responses are stored in JSON format or a simple database (SQLite/PostgreSQL).
Users can export results as CSV/PDF.
Deployment:

Can be deployed locally via python app.py.
Supports Docker for cloud deployment.
Future Enhancements:
Implement calibration settings for different audio devices.
Introduce noise masking to prevent environmental interference.
Allow integration with medical-grade audiometry devices.
